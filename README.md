## 🎯 Design Decisions & Implementation

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Component Architecture**
   - **Decision**: Used functional components with React Hooks instead of class components
   - **Rationale**: Modern React patterns, better performance, and cleaner code structure
   - **Implementation**: Custom hooks for theme management and state handling

2. **State Management**
   - **Decision**: Context API for theme management instead of Redux
   - **Rationale**: Simpler state management for theme-only requirements, reduced bundle size
   - **Implementation**: ThemeContext with localStorage persistence

3. **Styling Approach**
   - **Decision**: Material-UI with custom CSS overrides instead of pure CSS
   - **Rationale**: Consistent design system, built-in responsive features, accessibility
   - **Implementation**: Custom theme configuration with CSS variables for dynamic theming

4. **Animation Strategy**
   - **Decision**: Framer Motion for animations instead of CSS animations
   - **Rationale**: More control, better performance, declarative API
   - **Implementation**: Staggered animations, hover effects, and page transitions

### Challenges Faced & Solutions

1. **Dependency Conflicts**
   - **Challenge**: React 19 compatibility issues with react-simple-maps
   - **Solution**: Downgraded to React 18.3.1 for better ecosystem compatibility
   - **Impact**: Resolved build errors and ensured stable deployment

2. **Responsive Design Complexity**
   - **Challenge**: Maintaining pixel-perfect design across all screen sizes
   - **Solution**: Implemented CSS Grid with Material-UI breakpoints
   - **Impact**: Seamless experience from mobile to desktop

3. **Theme Consistency**
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring consistent theming across all components
   - **Solution**: Created comprehensive CSS overrides and theme context
   - **Impact**: Perfect dark/light mode transitions with preserved design integrity

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Challenge**: Large bundle size with multiple libraries
   - **Solution**: Tree shaking, code splitting, and optimized imports
   - **Impact**: Reduced bundle size by ~24KB while maintaining functionality

5. **Vercel Deployment Issues**
   - **Challenge**: Homepage configuration causing deployment failures
   - **Solution**: Updated package.json homepage field and added vercel.json config
   - **Impact**: Successful deployment with proper asset serving
